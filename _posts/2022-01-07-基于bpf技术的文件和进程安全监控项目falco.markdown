What does Falco do?
Falco uses system calls to secure and monitor a system, by:

Parsing the Linux system calls from the kernel at runtime
Asserting the stream against a powerful rules engine
Alerting when a rule is violated
For more information, see Falco Rules.

What does Falco check for?
Falco ships with a default set of rules that check the kernel for unusual behavior such as:

Privilege escalation using privileged containers
Namespace changes using tools like setns
Read/Writes to well-known directories such as /etc, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, etc
Creating symlinks
Ownership and Mode changes
Unexpected network connections or socket mutations
Spawned processes using execve
Executing shell binaries such as sh, bash, csh, zsh, etc
Executing SSH binaries such as ssh, scp, sftp, etc
Mutating Linux coreutils executables
Mutating login binaries
Mutating shadowutil or passwd executables such as shadowconfig, pwck, chpasswd, getpasswd, change, useradd, etc, and others.
 
 ```
