/lib64/libnspr4.so


Description of problem:
 The nss-softokn packaging does not have a requirement for a matching nspr package. As a result, the installation of the glibc.i686 package pulls in nss-softokn-freebl, but not the additionally required nspr version.

 

Yes, it looks like a duplicate of bug 1477308.  According to the rpm list attached to comment 2, only nss-softokn-freebl got updated while nspr was older (and missing PR_GetEnvSecure):

$ grep '^nss\|^nspr' nss-rpm_-qa.txt | sort


[root@localhost]# rpm -qa | grep '^nss\|^nspr' | sort
nspr-4.13.1-1.0.el7_3.x86_64
nss-3.28.4-15.el7_4.x86_64
nss-pem-1.0.3-4.el7.x86_64
nss-softokn-3.28.3-8.el7_4.x86_64
nss-softokn-freebl-3.28.3-8.el7_4.x86_64
nss-sysinit-3.28.4-15.el7_4.x86_64
nss-tools-3.28.4-15.el7_4.x86_64
nss-util-3.28.4-3.el7.x86_64





So this is workaround for broken system.

1. Use wget, or any other way to get the needed nspr package from the repository.
   
   needed package: nspr-4.13.1-1.0.el7_3

2. get the nspr libraries out from rpm

   rpm2cpio nspr-4.13.1-1.0.el7_3.x86_64.rpm |cpio -imdv

3. copy them to /usr/lib64/
 
   cp usr/lib64/* /usr/lib64/



Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI operating system facilities. The nss-util packages provide utilities for use with the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries. Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications.

The following packages have been updated to the latest upstream versions: nspr (4.13.1), nss-util (3.28.2), nss (3.28.2). This provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous versions. Notable enhancements include:

The NSPR and NSS-UTIL libraries now provide new utility functions. In addition, the libraries have received a variety of bug fixes, including several thread safety problems.
The Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) extension in NSS has been replaced by the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension.
NSS now supports the Finite Field Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Parameters (FFDHE) negotiation.
